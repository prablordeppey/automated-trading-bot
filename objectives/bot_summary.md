# ROADMAP for Automated Trading Bot Development

## Objective

Develop a trading bot that automatically determines assets to trade based on historical data, utilizes multiple indicators for signal confirmation, and optionally allows users to supply custom parameters.

## Steps:

### 1. Market Scan

- Define metrics for scanning the market (e.g., volatility, volume, trend strength).
- Specify criteria for selecting potential assets based on the defined metrics.
- Implement an automated process to scan and filter assets that meet the criteria.

### 2. Parameter Optimization (Grid Search)

- Identify parameters for each indicator/strategy (e.g., fastlength, slowlength, signallength for MACD).
- Define a range of values for the grid search.
- Specify a performance metric (e.g., return on investment, win rate) for evaluating each set of parameters.
- Implement an automated grid search to find optimal parameters using historical data.

### 3. Signal Computation

- Define the strategy/logic for computing signals based on the optimized parameters.
- Specify conditions for executing buy or sell orders (e.g., MACD line crossing the signal line).
- Implement automated signal computation based on historical data.

### 4. Trade Execution

- Specify profit margin criteria for trade execution.
- Define entry, take profit (TP), and stop loss (SL) prices based on computed parameters and profit margins.
- Implement automated trade execution based on confirmed signals.
- Integrate user-specific details for executing trades (e.g., account credentials).

### 5. User Interaction (Optional)

- Develop an optional user interface for users to supply custom parameters.
- Allow users to override automated settings and input their own parameters for indicators and strategies.
- Ensure a seamless integration between automated and user-supplied parameters.

### 6. Risk Management

- Implement risk management strategies, such as position sizing based on account balance and risk-reward ratio.
- Ensure the bot adheres to predefined risk management rules to protect the user's capital.

### 7. Logging and Monitoring

- Develop a robust logging system to record key information (e.g., executed trades, parameters used, performance metrics).
- Implement real-time monitoring features to track the bot's performance.

### 8. Backtesting

- Include a backtesting step to validate the effectiveness of the strategy using historical data.
- Ensure the bot performs well under various market conditions.

### 9. Error Handling

- Define how the bot should handle errors or unexpected situations during parameter optimization, signal computation, or trade execution.
- Implement mechanisms for alerting users in case of critical errors.

## Conclusion

The developed trading bot should be capable of autonomously determining assets to trade, optimizing parameters, and executing trades based on historical data. The optional user interaction feature enhances flexibility, allowing users to customize bot behavior.

## INDICATOR STRATEGIES

1. Moving Average Crossover
   - Indicators
     - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
     - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
   - Strategy
     - Buy when a shorter term SMA (e.g 50-day) crosses above a longer term SMA (e.g 200-day).
     - Sell when the shorter term SMA crosses below the longer term SMA.
   - TP/SL
     Determine a fixed percentage as TP and SL levels. eg set TP at 2% above the entry point
     and SL at 1% below the entry price.
1. MACD + Stochastic

   - Indicators
     - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
     - Stochastic Oscillator
   - Strategy
     - Buy when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and the stochastic oscillator is
       in oversold territory (below 20).
     - Sell when the MACD line crosses below the signal line and the stochastic oscillator is in overbought territory (above 80).
   - TP/SL
     Set TP and SL levels based on the average true range (ATR) of recent price movements.
     For instance, set TP at 1.5 times the ATR and SL at 1 times the ATR.

1. Bollinger Bands + RSI

   - Indicators
     - Bollinger Bands
     - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   - Strategy
     - Buy when price touches the lower Bollinger Band and the RSI is oversold (below 30).
     - Sell when the price touches the upper Bollinger Band and the RSI is overbought (above 70).
   - TP/SL
     Determine TP and SL based on the width of the Bollinger Bands. Eg. set TP at the lower band.

1. Fibonacci Retracement
   - Indicators
     - Fibonacci Retracement Levels
   - Strategy
     - Buy at a retracement level (e.g 38.2% or 50%) after an uptrend.
     - Sell at a retracement
       level after a downtrend
   - TP/SL
     Use fibonacci extensions or prior support/resistance levels to set TP and SL levels.
     For instance, set TP at the 161.8% Fibonacci extension and SL below the prior swing low.
