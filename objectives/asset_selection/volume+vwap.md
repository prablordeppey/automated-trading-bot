# Trading Pair Selection Based on Volume Metrics

## [x] Highest/Lowest Volume Pairs:

Identify the trading pairs with the highest 24-hour trading volumes. These pairs are often more liquid and may provide better opportunities for execution.

Compare the 24-hour trading volumes of different trading pairs. Look for pairs with significantly higher volumes compared to others.

Consider pairs with a higher VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price). VWAP is a measure that takes both price and volume into account, providing a more comprehensive view of the market.

## [ ] Volume Trends:

Analyze the trend in trading volumes for specific pairs. Pairs with increasing volumes might indicate growing interest and potential trading opportunities.

## [ ] Trading Strategy Thresholds:

Define thresholds for minimum and maximum trading volumes based on your trading strategy. For example, you might set a minimum volume requirement to ensure sufficient liquidity.
