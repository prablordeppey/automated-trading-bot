# Technical Indicator Strategies

1. **Moving Average Crossover**
   - **Indicators:**
     - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
     - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
   - **Strategy:**
     - Buy when a shorter-term SMA (e.g., 50-day) crosses above a longer-term SMA (e.g., 200-day).
     - Sell when the shorter-term SMA crosses below the longer-term SMA.
   - **TP/SL:**
     - Determine a fixed percentage as TP and SL levels (e.g., set TP at 2% above the entry point and SL at 1% below the entry price).

1. **MACD + Stochastic**
   - **Indicators:**
     - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
     - Stochastic Oscillator
   - **Strategy:**
     - Buy when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and the stochastic oscillator is in oversold territory (below 20).
     - Sell when the MACD line crosses below the signal line and the stochastic oscillator is in overbought territory (above 80).
   - **TP/SL:**
     - Set TP and SL levels based on the average true range (ATR) of recent price movements (e.g., set TP at 1.5 times the ATR and SL at 1 times the ATR).

1. **Bollinger Bands + RSI**
   - **Indicators:**
     - Bollinger Bands
     - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   - **Strategy:**
     - Buy when the price touches the lower Bollinger Band and the RSI is oversold (below 30).
     - Sell when the price touches the upper Bollinger Band and the RSI is overbought (above 70).
   - **TP/SL:**
     - Determine TP and SL based on the width of the Bollinger Bands (e.g., set TP at the lower band).

1. **Fibonacci Retracement**
   - **Indicators:**
     - Fibonacci Retracement Levels
   - **Strategy:**
     - Buy at a retracement level (e.g., 38.2% or 50%) after an uptrend.
     - Sell at a retracement level after a downtrend.
   - **TP/SL:**
     - Use Fibonacci extensions or prior support/resistance levels to set TP and SL levels (e.g., set TP at the 161.8% Fibonacci extension and SL below the prior swing low).

1. **Ichimoku Cloud**
   - **Indicators:**
     - Tenkan Sen, Kijun Sen, Senkou Span, Chikou Span
   - **Strategy:**
     - Buy when the Tenkan Sen crosses above the Kijun Sen, and the price is above the cloud.
     - Sell when the Tenkan Sen crosses below the Kijun Sen, and the price is below the cloud.
   - **TP/SL:**
     - Set TP and SL based on key levels within the Ichimoku Cloud.

1. **ADX + DI**
   - **Indicators:**
     - Average Directional Index (ADX)
     - Positive Directional Indicator (+DI) and Negative Directional Indicator (-DI)
   - **Strategy:**
     - Buy when +DI crosses above -DI and ADX indicates a strong trend.
     - Sell when +DI crosses below -DI and ADX indicates a weakening trend.
   - **TP/SL:**
     - Set TP and SL based on ADX levels and recent price movements.
